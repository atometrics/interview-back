/**
 *  A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the value of each node
 *  - is larger or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's left subtree and
 *  - is smaller than the values in all the nodes in that node's right subtree.
 *
 *  Write a function that, efficiently with respect to time used, checks if a given binary search tree contains a given value.
 *
 *  For example, for the following tree:
 *
 *   2
 *  / \
 *  1 5
 *
 *  n1 (Value: 1, Left: null, Right: null)
 *  n2 (Value: 2, Left: n1, Right: n3)
 *  n3 (Value: 5, Left: null, Right: null)
 *
 *  Hence, call to contains(n2, 5) should return true since the tree with root at n2 contains number 5.
